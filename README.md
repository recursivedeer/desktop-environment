# Desktop environment UI prototype

This is a simple prototype of a web-based desktop environment, which is written in React. Eventually, I would like to transform this into a cool personal page.

You can try to prototype [here](https://desktop-environment.vercel.app).

### Things left to do:

- Remove browser stuff
- Add text and icon attribution
- Put window on top when icon clicked
- Clean up calculator code (variable display size, logic)
- Try to remove inline styles as much as possible
- Add the metadata stuff (favicon, images for link sharing, etc)
- Recreate readme once completed
