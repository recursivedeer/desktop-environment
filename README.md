# Desktop environment UI prototype

This is a simple prototype of a web-based desktop environment, which is written in React. Eventually, I would like to transform this into a cool personal page.

You can try to prototype [here](https://desktop-environment.vercel.app).

### Things left to do:

- Implement support for minimize button
- Fix bug where latest maximized window is not always on top
- Implement calculator
- Implement browser
- Optimize code to prevent unnecessary reflows/layout trashing
- Add the metadata stuff (favicon, images for link sharing, etc)
- Create UI component for toggling between dark and light theme
- Implement movable desktop icons that opens the text editor or browser
- Add desktop icon that opens the text editor, which will show a short bio
- Add desktop icons that links my projects, which will open in the browser
- Add attributions for icons, which were taken on icons9.com
